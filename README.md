## Wanna Take a Look?

### View Live Demo

Here is a link to a [live demo](https://my-hd.herokuapp.com/) of the My-HD app in a production environment.

### Instantly Deploy Your Own My-HD Instance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a single click you can deploy your own private instance of the My-HD app on heroku. This feature is here so you can explore that app and its functionality.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

**__NOTE: Instant deploy is not recommended if you plan to set up My-HD as a user facing live production application. For this it is recommended that you clone this repository and develop locally__**

## Test Coverage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original iteration of My-HD was contracted for the creation for a private individual who did not require test coverage therefore it was not included. However, for the re-write of this application we will be addressing missing features, code smell and other issues re ran into running the v1 iteration of My-HD.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition we will be adding test coverage to core functionality and critical app logic. However do not get your hopes up. My-HD is a rapid prototype to production rails app that is light weight and intended to be customized. With that in mind it should not be difficult to cover sections of code that we did not address.
